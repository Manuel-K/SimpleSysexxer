=== General ===

If you want to compile from source, you need a development environment and the QT4 class library installed.

Open a terminal window and cd to the directory containing the file SimpleSysexxer.pro.

* Run qmake SimpleSysexxer.pro to create the Makefiles. Use Qt 4.5.0 or above. Previous versions probably won't work
* run make to build the application
* Move the resulting binary called 'simplesysexxer' to a directory of your likings or type make install to copy it to /usr/local/bin
